## Overview

**Project Title**: El Tiempo

**Project Description**: The Weather App is a user-friendly application designed to provide accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts. The app allows users to view current conditions up to five days, where they can have the option to use their own physical location or search for one they want to know. This real-time weather app aims to deliver reliable information in a visually appealing manner.

**Project Goals**: 
* Create an app that can provide a current and accurate information about the weather. 
* Learn and understand how to use API's
* Increase and learn more about JavaScript

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Create an OpenWeatherMap API account
2. Install a code editor 
3. Create a folder for the project with a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file 
4. Use navigator.geolocation in the script.js file to find the current user's location 

Instructions for using the software locally:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ayusomaciasj/weather-app.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd weather-app
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API key: API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
5. Start the development server: npm start
6. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
7. Enter a location in the search bar to view its weather information.
8. You can use the button "Use my location" to see the current weather or the place where you are


## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Modern Web browser(Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge)
* Code Editor(Visual Studio Code in my case)
* Following the Project structure Folder containing Index.html, style.css, script.js, and images folder
* Api Key
* Use the option of Live Server Extension is you are using Visual Studio Code
