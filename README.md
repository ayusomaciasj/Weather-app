This weather application is intended to provide real-time weather updates and a 5-day forecast. The app allows users to search for weather by city name or use their current location to display weather data, including temperature and condition.
Some of its features are: 
  -Real time weather updates
  -Weather forecast 
  -Geological support
  -Responsive design 
For this program I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and OpenWeatherMap API. 
This project helped me to understand a little more about API and Javascript.
